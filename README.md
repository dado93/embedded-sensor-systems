# Embedded Sensor Systems

This repository contains the code that I developed during the [*Embedded Sensor Systems*](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/manifestidott/manifestidott/controller/MainPublic.do?evn_dettaglioinsegnamento=evento&aa=2018&k_cf=82&k_corso_la=1380&ac_ins=0&lang=IT&caricaOffertaComune=true&c_insegn=053545&jaf_currentWFID=main) PhD course at Politecnico di Milano.

Projects were developed using a NUCLEO F401RE embedded on a custom board featuring sensors, LEDs, and other components.

The toolchain that was used for the development comprised:
 
 - SystemWorkBench for STM32 (used for CMSIS projects)
 - STM32CubeMX + Keil (used for HAL projects)
 
This is the list of the projects contained in this repository:
 - UART
